    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer and game developer from San Jose, California. I currently study at UC Irvine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in seeing what kind of games I have made, or possibly playing them, they are all availible for free on either my 
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dev/cy-game-dev" target="_blank" class="link">Steam Developer page</a>, or my
      <a href="https://coleyoung02.itch.io/" target="_blank" class="link">itch.io page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have interesets in mathematics and urban planning, though much less formal experience in the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I interned as a software engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory from June through September of 2024 where I did programming for satellite networking as well as web traffic generation on a 5g network.
      I previously interned as a web developer for CodeHS where I helped add new features and tools to the site, fix bugs, and improve accessability for screen-reader users and people with color-blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of professional and academic life, I enjoy cooking, live music, art, and deep dives to random topics on Wikipedia.
