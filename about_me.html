    <p>
      I am a software engineer and game developer from San Jose, California. I currently study at UC Irvine.

    <p>
      I also have interesets in mathematics and urban planning, though much less formal experience in the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have interned as a web developer for CodeHS where I helped add new features to the site, fix bugs, and improve accessability for screen-reader users and people with color-blindness.
      Starting in June of 2024 I will be a research intern at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of professional and academic life, I enjoy cooking, live music, art, and deep dives to random topics on Wikipedia.
