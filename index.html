      <p>A <a href="https://elestebann.itch.io/zot-racer" target="_blank" class="link">racing game</a> 
        developed with a team of 8 students from the UCI Video Game Development Club in the winter of 2023 using the Unreal Engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on the project as a gameplay programmer.
        I programmed all movement, controls, and physics for the car, as well as some supporting features
        like the logic for lap completion and counting, and sound effects.
        I also learned how to use Blender to do 3d modeling on this project, and DiVinci Resolve to make the trailer (full quality video viewable on the download page, this one is kind of compressed into oblivion).
        The game is unofficially one of the top 2 Zot-themed racing games of all time.

          This is a sleep tracking web app I made in the fall of 2022. I focused on making the interface easy to use in the most common case, 
          logging sleep for the current or previous night, while still having the ability to easily support logging historical sleep data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the visualization section I wanted to create an interface that could provide quick informative information. I achieved this
          by color coding sleep and energy data to the hours of sleep and reported energy level. A week by week breakdown is given with 
          the averages for hours of sleep and energy level given.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular with Ionic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleep data is pushed to and retrieved from a Firebase database using Angular Firestore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charts are generated with the Chart.js library.

          This is a web game I made with a partner in the Fall of 2022. The game can be played and navigated entirely by hand gestures.
          To develop the app, we first decided what we wanted to do with the handtracking software, and after deciding on the modified version of 
          rock, paper, scissors, we started designing the layout. Things were kept very simplistic so that we could make sure there were no more than 2 buttons
          to be used on screen at any time. Then I integrated the handtracking with each page and set up the buttons and navigation between pages. 
          I also made an angular service that would be used to run games and store results, and set up a system to read hand gestures into game moves. 
          My partener set up the rest of the gameplay code, including all of the logic for the timer and helped polish up the visuals and layout of 
          everything and did extensive bug testing. I then went in and added the charts in the stats section usin Chart.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigation is achieved by pointing either left or right to highlight a button, and then closing the pointing hand to "click" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular.
