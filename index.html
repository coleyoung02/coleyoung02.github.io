          This is a falling tile matching game I made in 2021.

          It is coded in Python using the Pygame library using a virtual environment and the IDLE editor that comes with python.

          I made this quiz platform with Java in 2022 to help me pass the CA DMV
          knowledge exam. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As existing online quiz resources have become increasingly expensive, I wanted to create a system that I could use to 
          test knowledge of multiple choice questions in a similar way, while emphasizing features that I know help me learn while 
          reducing distractions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The official DMV website has example quizzes, but they are very limited, and I found the interface clunky and difficult to 
          use. Users can only test on sets of 10 questions at a time, and don't see if their answers are correct until after submitting 
          the entire block of 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project shows the user their score as they progress through the quiz so they have feedback on their performance, 
          and immediately gives feedback on the correctness of the user's guesses. Users can also attempt more guesses after initially
          getting the question wrong, which encourages them to try to learn the correct answer, even after making a mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          I coded this using a Maven project on eclipse with the org.json and swing libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am still making updates to this project as I come up with new ideas to improve it.
