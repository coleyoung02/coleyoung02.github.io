        I was the co-team lead and programming lead on a team of 8 UCI students (4 programmers and 4 artists) developing a <a href="https://mistyl.itch.io/conjure-chaos" class="link">2d magical arena figthing game</a> in Unity using C#. 
        The game has 11 waves, 22 distinct stacking upgrades, 22 completed animations, and 10 different enemies with 5 unique types. For this game, we were really focusing on giving the player
        a sense that they are becoming powerful as they build up a pool of upgrades and I think the team did a great job of that. There are about 10-15 minutes of gameplay in one run from start to finish, 
        but the game is quite challenging and will probably take several attempts to beat. The game is free to <a href="https://mistyl.itch.io/conjure-chaos" class="link">download on itch.io</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally architected and implemented the upgrade management system, and programmed almost all of the UI elements, and many of the upgrade effects. I also helped guide the programming team, some of which were beginners in the Unity engine.

        I led a team of 8 UCI students in developing this <a href="https://coleyoung02.itch.io/king-of-the-ring" class="link">chess boxing arcade game</a>. It combines retro boxing game style gameplay with challenging chess against an AI opponent. 
        Just like the real life sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing" class="link">chess boxing</a>, the gameplay alternates between rounds of chess and boxing until a knockout or checkmate.
        To my knowledge, this is the best (and only) chess boxing video game ever created.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chess engine and AI uses C# running in unity, and is threaded in parallel with the rest of the game to ensure smoothness while the relatively intense computation happens in the background. 
        The game's AI also considers how much time it has remaining, how complex the position is, how close the game is to ending, and a number of other factors when deciding how deep to think about making a move.
        The chess engine and AI were made by me from scratch, but inspiration was taken from a

        developed with a team of 8 students from the UCI Video Game Development Club in the winter of 2023 using the Unreal Engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on the project as a gameplay programmer.
        I programmed all movement, controls, and physics for the car, as well as some supporting features
        like the logic for lap completion and counting, and sound effects.
        I also learned how to use Blender to do 3d modeling on this project, and DiVinci Resolve to make the trailer (full quality video viewable on the download page, this one is kind of compressed into oblivion).
        The game is unofficially one of the top 2 Zot-themed racing games of all time.

          This is a sleep tracking web app I made in the fall of 2022. I focused on making the interface easy to use in the most common case, 
          logging sleep for the current or previous night, while still having the ability to easily support logging historical sleep data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the visualization section I wanted to create an interface that could provide quick informative information. I achieved this
          by color coding sleep and energy data to the hours of sleep and reported energy level. A week by week breakdown is given with 
          the averages for hours of sleep and energy level given.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular with Ionic.

        <p>
          Sleep data is pushed to and retrieved from a Firebase database using Angular Firestore.

          The charts are generated with the Chart.js library.

          This is a web game I made with a partner in the Fall of 2022. The game can be played and navigated entirely by hand gestures.
          To develop the app, we first decided what we wanted to do with the handtracking software, and after deciding on the modified version of 
          rock, paper, scissors, we started designing the layout. Things were kept very simplistic so that we could make sure there were no more than 2 buttons
          to be used on screen at any time. Then I integrated the handtracking with each page and set up the buttons and navigation between pages. 
          I also made an angular service that would be used to run games and store results, and set up a system to read hand gestures into game moves. 
          My partener set up the rest of the gameplay code, including all of the logic for the timer and helped polish up the visuals and layout of 
          everything and did extensive bug testing. I then went in and added the charts in the stats section usin Chart.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigation is achieved by pointing either left or right to highlight a button, and then closing the pointing hand to "click" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular.
