      <p>A <a href="https://maidandready.itch.io/yakamoto-clean-sweep" target="_blank" class="link">first person cleaning game</a> 
        developed with a team from the UCI Video Game Development Club in the fall of 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on the project as the UI/UX lead and as a programmer.

          This is a sleep tracking web app I made in the fall of 2022. I focused on making the interface easy to use in the most common case, 
          logging sleep for the current or previous night, while still having the ability to easily support logging historical sleep data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the visualization section I wanted to create an interface that could provide quick informative information. I achieved this
          by color coding sleep and energy data to the hours of sleep and reported energy level. A week by week breakdown is given with 
          the averages for hours of sleep and energy level given.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular with Ionic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleep data is pushed to and retrieved from a Firebase database using Angular Firestore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charts are generated with the Chart.js library.

          This is a web game I made with a partner in the Fall of 2022. The game can be played and navigated entirely by hand gestures.
          To develop the app, we first decided what we wanted to do with the handtracking software, and after deciding on the modified version of 
          rock, paper, scissors, we started designing the layout. Things were kept very simplistic so that we could make sure there were no more than 2 buttons
          to be used on screen at any time. Then I integrated the handtracking with each page and set up the buttons and navigation between pages. 
          I also made an angular service that would be used to run games and store results, and set up a system to read hand gestures into game moves. 
          My partener set up the rest of the gameplay code, including all of the logic for the timer and helped polish up the visuals and layout of 
          everything and did extensive bug testing. I then went in and added the charts in the stats section usin Chart.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigation is achieved by pointing either left or right to highlight a button, and then closing the pointing hand to "click" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular.

            I made this quiz platform with Java in the summer of 2022 to help me pass the CA DMV knowledge exam. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As existing online quiz resources have become increasingly expensive, I wanted to create a system that I could use to 
            test knowledge of multiple choice questions in a similar way, while emphasizing features that I know help me learn while 
            reducing distractions. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The official DMV website has example quizzes, but they are very limited, and I found the interface clunky and difficult to 
            use. Users can only test on sets of 10 questions at a time, and don't see if their answers are correct until after submitting 
            the entire block of 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project shows the user their score as they progress through the quiz so they have feedback on their performance, 
            and immediately gives feedback on the correctness of the user's guesses. Users can also attempt more guesses after initially
            getting the question wrong, which encourages them to try to learn the correct answer, even after making a mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            I coded this using a Maven project on eclipse with the org.json and swing libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am still making updates to this project as I come up with new ideas to improve it.
