        <p>
          I was the co-team lead and programming lead on a team of 8 UCI students (4 programmers and 4 artists) developing a <a href="https://mistyl.itch.io/conjure-chaos" class="link">2d magical arena figthing game</a> in Unity using C#. 
          The game has 11 waves, 22 distinct stacking upgrades, 22 completed animations, and 10 different enemies with 5 unique types. For this game, we were really focusing on giving the player
          a sense that they are becoming powerful as they build up a pool of upgrades and I think the team did a great job of that. There are about 10-15 minutes of gameplay in one run from start to finish, 
          but the game is quite challenging and will probably take several attempts to beat. The game is free to <a href="https://mistyl.itch.io/conjure-chaos" class="link">download on itch.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I personally architected and implemented the upgrade management system, and programmed almost all of the UI elements, and many of the upgrade effects. I also helped guide the programming team, some of which were beginners in the Unity engine.
