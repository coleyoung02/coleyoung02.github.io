          <a href="https://coleyoung02.itch.io/la-danza" class="link">La Danza del Político</a> is a strategy game where you play as a South American politician in the early 1970s trying not to get killed by the CIA. The game is free to <a href="https://coleyoung02.itch.io/la-danza" class="link">download or run in your browser</a> on itch.io.

          I was the sole programmer, designer, and writer for this game. It was made over about 2 weeks for the 2025 Fuck Capitalism Game Jam.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this game, I made sure to implement systems that were easy to tweak as I assumed that it would take a lot of effort and iteration to properly balance the gameplay to be both approachable and still challenging.
          I also spent a considerable amount of time facilitating playtesting sessions with several different users, and making iterative changes in the form of both numeric tweaks, and interface improvements to make sure the game was easy to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the technical and gameplay considerations, I also spent time researching the geography and politics of South America, and the foreign policy of the United States during the period to ensure some degree of historical accuracy.
          While the game is not trying to exactly depict any one country, individual, or event (with the exception of Henry Kissinger), the goal was to draw attention to the general pattern of 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor#U.S._involvement" target="_blank" class="link">undemocratic interventions</a> and the repression of freedom to speak and organize facilitated in the name of US business and geopolitical interests.
