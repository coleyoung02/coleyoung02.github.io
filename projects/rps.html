          This is a web game I made with a partner in the Fall of 2022. The game can be played and navigated entirely by hand gestures.
          To develop the app, we first decided what we wanted to do with the handtracking software, and after deciding on the modified version of 
          rock, paper, scissors, we started designing the layout. Things were kept very simplistic so that we could make sure there were no more than 2 buttons
          to be used on screen at any time. Then I integrated the handtracking with each page and set up the buttons and navigation between pages. 
          I also made an angular service that would be used to run games and store results, and set up a system to read hand gestures into game moves. 
          My partener set up the rest of the gameplay code, including all of the logic for the timer and helped polish up the visuals and layout of 
          everything and did extensive bug testing. I then went in and added the charts in the stats section usin Chart.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigation is achieved by pointing either left or right to highlight a button, and then closing the pointing hand to "click" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made using Angular.
