          I was the co-team lead and programming lead on a team of UCI students working on this surreal cooking game. 
          The game follows an unnamed bear as it tries desperately to assemble a sandwich, though many obstacles get in its way.
          The main mechanic of the game is manipulating your hands to grab and move objects. The game is fully voice acted, and has a Spanish translation
          (also with full voice acting) to be released shortly.
          The game is free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925430/Sandwich_Sim" class="link">download on Steam</a>.
        </p>

          For this project, I did a little bit of everything (and a lot of programming). I wrote all of the English dialog and created a cutscene system to 
          display captions in sync with the audio tracks, recorded and implemented all voice acting, programmed shaders for post processing, modeled and textured many of the 3d assets,
          managed team members across many disciplines, designed, implemented and iterated on mechanics, published to Steam and did some basic marketing, and even used a little bit of
          what I learned in high school Spanish class.
